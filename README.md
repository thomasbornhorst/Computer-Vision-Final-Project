# Computer-Vision-Final-Project

Step 1:
Design Faster R-CNN of some sort to create bounding boxes, and train a subset of the video frames from SoccerTrack dataset.

Step 2:
Track player identities across frames.

^^ Try to do before Monday April 8th ^^

Step 3:
Associate players with their specific team.

Step 4:
Try to collect information such as which team has possession when, regions where players/ball most commonly are, formation, etc. This can be as big as we want.
